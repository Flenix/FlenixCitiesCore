Plans for any planned AI classes.

Basically, if it's in here I plan to write an AI class for it. AI classes add functionality for the NPCs, and can be used by anyone who wants to make a module.

- AICrimeWeapon
Checks if a player is weilding a weapon. If so, sets a Crime rating depending on what the weapon is. The weapon crime rating is only set once, for the highest-rated weapon they hold 
(Eg if they're holding a kitchen knife from Home, they'd get a crime of 1 (for example). If it was a bazooka from enforcement, it'd probably be an 8 or 9. Variable is radius to police officer.

- AICrimeDrug
Checks if a player is holding drugs. Alcohol and cigarettes are ignored. Like weapon, it's set once, to the highest rated drug. Variable is radius to police officer.

- AICrimeAssault
Witness-based. If you attack someone (player or Cities NPC - not mobs etc), you'll get an Assault rating. Only takes effect if either whatever gets attacked survives 
(10 seconds without taking damage), or if an NPC with AICrimeWitness/Police Officer applied sees the attack. Variable is radius to police officer.

- AICrimePolice
Given to police officers. Makes them "notice" the crimes and alter the players crime rating accordingly.

- AICrimeArrest
Given to police officers. They will target players with a crime rating. Different actions depending on the crime rating:
1-3 - When targetting, opens up a GUI on the player asking what they want to do - Pay a fine, go to jail or run.
4-6 - Opens the GUI, but no fine option.
7+ - No GUI, police just go for the kill.

- AICrimeVigilante
When the players crime rating is above 7, any NPC with this AI will attack. Variable is a weapon that they can draw.

- AICrimeWitness
Given to people who would report crimes. Same as AICrimePolice, but delayed for 15 seconds. If the NPC is killed during this time, then it's cancelled.
When triggered, if Office is installed the NPC will switch to wielding a myPhone. Variable is radius around the player.

- AICitiCrime

- AIVigilante 
If the Vigilante AI is enabled, a NPC will attack anyone with a crime rating above the amount defined.
